## Project Overview 
In this coding challenge, I utilized HPCC System's coding language ECL to solve a series of problems to analyze three public music datasets: Music Mozilla Dataset, Million Song Dataset, Spotify Million Dataset.

## Challenges and Solutions 
Setting up the HPCC enviroment and learning the syntac of ECL were some difficulties that I faced. I was able to overcome these problems by: 
   <p> - Engaging with the challenge sponsors: With the teachings and guidance from the sponsors, my experience with learning a new langauge went by more smoothly. </p>

## Datasets Used 

1. Music Mozilla Dataset - a comprehensive directory of all things music, edited by volunteers.
2. Million Song Dataset - a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks
3. Spotify Million Dataset - extracted from the Spotify platform using the Python library "Spotipy", which allows users to access music data provided via APIs


## Tools Utilized
GitHub Copilot: 
    <p>Used to help me fix syntax errors, and help me understand how use the functions in ECL.</p>
